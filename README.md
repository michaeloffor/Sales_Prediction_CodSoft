<h1>Sales Prediction Based on Advertisement</h1>
<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<p>This project aims to predict sales based on advertisement spending across different media channels. By analyzing how advertising budgets in TV, radio, and newspapers influence sales, the goal is to build a machine learning model that accurately predicts sales outcomes.</p>

<h2>Dataset</h2>
<p>The dataset used for this project includes the following features:</p>

<li>TV: Budget spent on TV advertisements (in thousands of dollars).</li>
<li>Radio: Budget spent on radio advertisements (in thousands of dollars).</li>
<li>Newspaper: Budget spent on newspaper advertisements (in thousands of dollars).</li>
<li>Sales: Sales generated (in thousands of units) [Target variable].</li>
<h2>Project Structure</h2>
<li>Data Preprocessing: Cleaning the data, handling missing values, and preparing it for model training.</li>
<li>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing the relationships between advertising budgets and sales to understand how each medium influences sales.</li>
<li>Model Training: Training various machine learning models</li>
<li>Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of the model using metrics like mean squared error (MSE), R-squared (RÂ²), and mean absolute error (MAE).</li>
<li>Prediction: Predicting sales based on new advertisement budget data</li>
